# Big-data-projects
Contains the projects done in Big Data Computer Systems course in Masters at the University of Utah

1. Page Rank: Developed a program which calculates the page rank of the nodes (pages) of a graph based on its connectivity   matrix. It also takes into account the trust level of each page to calculate the Trust Rank. It is implemented in Java on Hadoop framework using Map Reduce architecture.

2. MPI Parallel Programming: Implemented Graph Coloring and Matrix Multiplication algorithms in parallel. The graph coloring algorithm colors a graph in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. These algorithms were implemented in C langugage using the MPI/MPI-IO framework.

3. Web Crawler: Built a parallel focused web crawler compliant with Robot Exclusion Standard and URL redundancy recognition. The crawler runs in two modes:
Host specific: Crawling is limited within the web domain of the seed URL.
Topic Specific: Crawling on pages on a specific topic.
Technologies used were Java, Java Swing and JSoup
